# ðŸª™ðŸª™ Coin Change Calculator - Frontend ðŸª™ðŸª™

A React frontend app built with Vite that allows users to calculate coin denominations for a target amount. It communicates with a backend API to fetch the optimal coin combination.

Built for a challenge

---

## Assumptions made for challenge

- If there's no possible combination to reach target exactly, the least coins combination will be returned, but will not be equal to target

---

## Features

- Select coin denominations interactively
- Input target amount with validation (up to 2 decimals)
- Displays the calculated coin change breakdown
- Auto-deployment on GitHub Pages (https://im-ksc.github.io/coin-calculator-frontend/)
